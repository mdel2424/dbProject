Languages:
Apache Tomcat
Java
HTML/CSS/js
PostgreSQL

DB steps:
1. Create a database called "dbProject"
2. Open a query tool for this database, and run the two sql files found in the db/queryTool folder, schema first, then data, in order.

To start:
To start the app, simply run the start tomcat.bat in the root folder. All the java code is in dbProject/code. All the Html/css/js is in apache-tomcat/webapps/dbProject/

Admin code is 1.
Employee code does not matter

Indexes:
Indexes on Foreign Key Columns: Given the nature of operations in a booking system, indexes on foreign key columns can accelerate JOIN operations between tables. An index on clientId in the booking table improves performance when retrieving all bookings for a specific client.

Composite Index for Booking Date Range Searches: Queries to find bookings within specific date ranges are common. A composite index on startDate and endDate in the booking table could make these queries more efficient, especially for operations like checking room availability.

Index on Email and Username in the client Table: The application frequently performs operations involving client login or lookup by email/username, so an index on the email and username column significantly reduces login times and improves user experience.



Triggers and request: Refer to the db/queryTool folder for all the sql examples.
